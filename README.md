# EPICS Module for the SLAC LCLS2 HPS MPS System

## Description

l2MpsAsyn uses CPSW for the communication with FPGA and AsynPortDriver for its integration into EPICS.

The modules must be load in all the LCLS-II HPS application. It will automatically create PVs for all the MPS related information part of the Common Platform.

## Documentation

You can find several README files which describe different aspects of the module:
